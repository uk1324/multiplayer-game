Synchronization
To see if the prediction is synchronized with the server version draw both the prediction and the server interpolated version, just drawing the server send version on this frame won't work.
Sometimes you need to add or subtract time that is used for compensation.
If things are desynchronized it might be be some constant value like DT or SERVER_UPDATE_SENT_RATE_DIVISOR * DT. Just use trail and error to find the right value if that is the case.
