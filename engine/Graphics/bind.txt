I decided to automatically bind before every operation, because I made too many mistakes of forgetting to bind. If this is a performance issue could save the currently bound values in a static array and check if is already bound. Would also need to convert other bind calls that are outside of the class to calls that save the value. This probably shouldn't be an issue though, because I nevery use those.
