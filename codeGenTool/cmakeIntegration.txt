I wanted cmake to reconfigure when a .data file was added or delated, but all I found is CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS, which reconfigures on creation, delation and modification. In my case cmake doesn't need to be reconfigured on modification, because modification is already handled by add_custom_command DEPENDS. To make it reconfigure only when a new file is added CmakeGenerator watches the directory and writes to a file that is added to CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS when a new file is added.
