I wanted cmake to reconfigure when a .data file was added or delated, but all I found is CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS, which reconfigures on creation, delation and modification. In my case cmake doesn't need to be reconfigured on modification, because modification is already handled by add_custom_command DEPENDS. To make it reconfigure only when a new file is added CmakeGenerator watches the directory and writes to a file that is added to CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS when a new file is added.

From https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html
Do not list the output in more than one independent target that may build in parallel or the instances of the rule may conflict. Instead, use the add_custom_target() command to drive the command and make the other targets depend on that one. See the Example: Generating Files for Multiple Targets below.

When I tried using add_custom_command then things would break when you 
Modify .data a file with a generated .hpp that is included by some other file.
On the first build the .hpp would get generated, but the old .hpp would be included.
On the second build the right .hpp file would be included and there would be an error.
Modify the .data file to be correct again.
The build wouldn't even get to generating the .hpp file.
The only way to fix it would be to modify the .hpp file to not cause the error.
And only then would on the next rebuild the generate for the .data file would get called.

Using add_custom_target like described in 
https://samthursfield.wordpress.com/2015/11/21/cmake-dependencies-between-targets-and-files-and-custom-commands/
fixes the the ordering issue, but the double issues presits. The issues only happens if you use F5 to build. It doesn't happen when using Ctrl + Shift + B
