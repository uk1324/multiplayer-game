For types that cannot be default intitialized could just create a different convention for serializing that would work for reading only.
Instead of returning a boolean it would be passed as an argument.

auto struct = serializeStruct(stream, flag);
if (!flag) {
	return false;
}

Could put all of this into a macro that takes a variable name as input.

Technically you could use pointers or smart pointers.
